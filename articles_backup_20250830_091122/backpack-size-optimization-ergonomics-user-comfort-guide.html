                    <h2>Understanding Backpack Size Fundamentals</h2>
                    <div class="content-with-image">

                        <p>Proper backpack sizing is the foundation of comfort and ergonomic health. Unlike clothing sizes, backpack sizing is primarily based on your <strong>torso length</strong>, not your height or weight. This measurement determines how the backpack's frame and hip belt align with your body.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How to Measure Your Torso Length</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Find your C7 vertebra:</strong> Tilt your head forward and locate the prominent bone at the base of your neck</li>
                            <li><strong>Locate your iliac crest:</strong> Place your hands on your hips and find the top of your hip bones</li>
                            <li><strong>Measure the distance:</strong> Use a flexible tape measure to find the distance between these two points</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Ergonomic backpack design is based on scientific principles that minimize strain on your musculoskeletal system. Understanding these principles helps you identify quality backpacks and use them correctly.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The 10% Rule and Weight Distribution</h3>
                        <p>Medical professionals recommend that your loaded backpack should not exceed <strong>10% of your body weight</strong> for daily use, or 20% for short-term hiking. However, proper weight distribution is equally important:</p>

                                <li><strong>Heavy items (60-70%):</strong> Close to your back, between shoulder blades</li>
                                <li><strong>Medium items (20-30%):</strong> Middle compartments and side pockets</li>

                            <li><strong>Nerve compression:</strong> Tingling or numbness in arms and hands</li>
                            <li><strong>Muscle fatigue:</strong> Premature exhaustion during activities</li>

                                <h4>Step 1: Measure Your Torso Length</h4>
                                <p>Have someone measure from your C7 vertebra (prominent bone at base of neck) to the top of your hip bones. This determines your backpack size category.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Small:</strong> 15-17 inches (38-43 cm)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Medium:</strong> 17-19 inches (43-48 cm)</li>

                                <h4>Step 2: Adjust the Suspension System</h4>
                                <p>Set the shoulder straps so they curve over your shoulders without gaps. The load lifter straps should angle upward at 45 degrees from your shoulders.</p>

                                <p>The padded hip belt should sit on your hip bones (iliac crest), not your waist. It should be snug but not restrictive, carrying 80% of the weight.</p>
